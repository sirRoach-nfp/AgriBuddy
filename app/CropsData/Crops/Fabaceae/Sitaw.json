Cover with 3-4 centimeters of soil. During the rainy season or in areas with poor drainage, plant string beans and cowpeas on raised beds or ridges 10-30 cm high."

Remove weeds that may compete with the plants for nutrients. Perform cultivation between rows 10-15 days after germination to prevent weeds from growing. Raise the ridges 25-30 days after germination. String beans are commonly attacked by cutworms, bugs, beanfly, aphids, and pod borers. Inspect the field 3-10 days after germination for the presence of beanfly. Apply control measures if the infestation is severe. Common diseases of string beans include fusarium wilt, stem and root rot, bean rust, bean mosaic, and powdery mildew."

Do not allow the seeds inside the pods to mature and harden before harvesting. Harvest green pods twice a week, preferably in the morning or afternoon when the temperature is cooler to keep them fresh. Keep harvested string beans under shade to prevent wilting. Sort and clean the string beans according to size, color, and maturity. Remove those damaged by insects and diseases."
