One gram contains approximately 250 seeds.\n\nThere are two methods of raising eggplant seedlings: Seedbed Method and Seedling Tray Method.\n\nProtect the seedlings from excessive sunlight and rain using temporary shading materials such as plastic, cogon grass, talahib, or coconut leaves.\n\nCreate a shading structure that is 120 cm high on the east side and 60 cm high on the west side.\n\nWater the seedlings in the morning to prevent damping-off disease. The amount of water should be enough to keep the soil moist but not too wet.\n\nOverwatering weakens the seedlings and increases the risk of damping-off.\n\nOn the 10th day after germination, fertilize the seedlings with 1 teaspoon of urea (45-0-0) or ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) dissolved in 4 liters of water.\n\nAfter fertilization, water the seedbed to prevent leaf damage.\n\nOne week before transplanting, harden the seedlings by gradually exposing them to sunlight and reducing watering.\n\nOn the first day, expose the seedlings to sunlight until 10:00 AM, then gradually increase exposure time daily until they can withstand full-day sunlight.\n"
