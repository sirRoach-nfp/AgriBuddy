Construct the shade with a height of 12 centimeters on the east side and 60 centimeters on the west side.\n\nWater the seedlings in the morning to prevent damping-off. Ensure proper watering to keep the soil moist but not overly saturated, as excessive watering can cause damping-off and weak seedlings.\n\nApply one teaspoon of urea (45-0-0) dissolved in one gallon of water 10 days after germination. Immediately water the seedlings after fertilization to prevent leaf damage.\n\nOne week before transplanting, strengthen the seedlings by gradually exposing them to sunlight and adjusting watering."
